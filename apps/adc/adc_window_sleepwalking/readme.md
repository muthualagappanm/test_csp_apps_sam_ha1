# ADC window sleepwalking

This application shows how to configure ADC in a sleepwalking operation, where input voltage is measured at a fixed interval, but device is not woken from sleep until the measured value is below a given threshold.

## Description

This example application shows how to use the ADC Peripheral library to perform sleepwalking.
The ADC peripheral is configured to operate in window mode. The ADC conversion is triggered by RTC compare 0 event. On every trigger, window detection operation is performed in standby sleep. The window interrupt is generated when the input voltage falls below the window upper threshold and the CPU is woken up by this interrupt. ADC window upper threshold is configured as 1/4 th of the reference voltage.

### Setting up [SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO)

- Connect a voltage below the selected ADC reference voltage (VDDANA/2) to pin 4 (PA03 ) of the EXT1
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Note:
*ATSAMHA1G16A device in SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro board is not recommended for new design, hence replace the device with ATSAMHA1G16AB device. Connect the supported external debugger to Cortex Debug Port*

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. Console displays ADC Window Detected when ADC input is lower than 1/4 th of the reference
voltage (i.e below 0.4125 V):
